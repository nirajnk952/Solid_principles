## Solid JavaScript - solid principles in JavaScript

<hr />

### Single responsibility principle  (SRP)

> There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.


#### Examples:
- [single-responsibility-principle ](https://github.com/nirajnk952/Solid_principles/blob/main/srp.js)

<hr />

### Open/closed principle (OCP)

> Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.


#### Examples:

- [open-closed-principle](https://github.com/nirajnk952/Solid_principles/blob/main/ocp.js)

<hr />

### Liskov substitution principle (LSP)

> Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
> Child classes should be able to replace parent classes without causing errors or unexpected behavior.


#### Examples:
- [liskov-substitution-principle ](https://github.com/nirajnk952/Solid_principles/blob/main/lsp.js)

<hr />

### Interface segregation principle (ISP)

> Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
> No code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. 


#### Examples:
- [interface-segregation-principle ](https://github.com/nirajnk952/Solid_principles/blob/main/isp.js)

<hr />

### Dependency inversion principle (DIP)

> classes shouldnt depend on interfaces rather than concrete class
>  Depend upon abstractions, NOT concretions.


#### Examples:
- [dependency-inversion-principle](https://github.com/nirajnk952/Solid_principles/blob/main/dip.js)
